# EventHub Vite React Prototype

This folder is a minimal Vite + React scaffold extracted from the main `index.html`.
It contains a `Header` component converted from your existing HTML.

How to run locally:

1. cd eventhub-vite
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173

Notes:

- The header CSS is minimal and taken from the original page to preserve look/behavior.
- The component implements a simple mobile sidebar toggle and a scroll effect.
- If you want, I can extract more parts (hero, events grid) into React components next.
